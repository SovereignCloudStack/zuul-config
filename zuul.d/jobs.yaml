      The recommended base job.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.

      It also sets a default timeout value (which may be overidden).

      A base job variant with extra logs.

      In addition to the plain base job this collects extra logs,
      docs and artifacts from all nodes.
